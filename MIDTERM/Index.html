    <h3> DESCRIPTION</h3>
   
    <p> You will have a general lobotomy before the procedure. You will be asleep and be sympathetic-free.</p>
    
    <p> There are 2 steps during the HOMINIM BYPASS PROCEDURE:</p>
    
    <ul> 
    
    <li> The first step is to extract the personal demons. </li>
        
    <li> The second step is learn to live in your newly improved life. </li>
        
        <p> HOMINEM BYPASS can be done in two ways. With the open agenda, your warden makes a large cut to your social life. The bypass is done by focusing on your social network, friend group, and other circles of community, extracting the requested heathens on your application.</p>

        <p>Another way to do this procedure is to relocate the people you don't want it your life. Our special program will abduct these people and move them all to a remote island in the Bermuda Triangle. This method allows you to feel mentally better if you are more of the emotional type. </p>
