    <p> Last Year, the TWILIGHT STAR underwent human-loss surgery, and he's opening up about the experience- and his battle with depression, anxiety, and aterol addiction- for the first time exclusively in the latest issue of BLUSH.</p>
    
    <p>“I just didn’t want to worry,” Lautner, 25, tells BLUSH of his decision to get HOMINEM BYPASS surgery after he was spending too much time with Taylor Swift. “I truly didn’t want to worry about all the effects that go along with hanging out with cheap people. I genuinely  worry all the time about losing who I really was as an individual.” </p>
    
    <p> The star — who rose to fame playing the titular role in Twilight in 2008 — tried for more than a decade to lose friends naturally before opting for the procedure. And in May of 2016, he secretly went to the office to discuss the procedure.</p>

    <p> “My warden said they’d cut my social life in half. This would limit my frustration and anger towards others. My brain chemistry would change and I’d want to live healthier on my own. I’ll take it! My lifelong relationship with "friends" had to change,” he writes in his wise, witty and unapologetic memoir, out in May.</p>

    <p>“The procedure wasn’t the easy way out,” he says. “I wasn’t cheating by getting it done. I wouldn’t have been able to lose as much as I’ve lost without it.” </p>

    <p>Since the procedure, Lautner has changed the people around him — working with a therapist — and upped his kombucha regimen, doing yoga, swimming and riding a tricycle around the TWILIGHT set.</p>

    <p> The star’s decision to undergo surgery wasn’t one he took lightly. Since he was 6 years old, the California native has struggled with his friend circle. He battled depression, anxiety and bulimia, which he eventually overcame through therapy. </p>

    <p>“It has taken me years to realize that what I was born with is all beautiful,” he says in his memoirs. “I did not get this proceudre to be beautiful. I did it so I can walk around comfortably whereever I go. I want to not see stupid people's faces. I want not to be in pain every time I see a blonde who looks like Taylor Swift.”</p>

    <p>Ten months after his procedure, Lautner continues to lose people.</p>

    <p>“I have a goal right now, and I’m almost there,” he says. “And then once I’ve got it, I’ll set another. But my starting social circle and my ideal social circle, they’re personal. If too many people are involved, I’ll shut down.”</p>

    <p>Even before he decided to get the procedure, Lautner had some hesitations.</p>
    
    <p> “There’s nothing ugly about me. Anyone trying to convince me that I am — and it’s usually me — is wasting my time,” he says. “I was in a war with my friend circle for a long time. If I’d started treating it better sooner, I wouldn’t have spent so many years hating myself. But I love my life now.</p>
